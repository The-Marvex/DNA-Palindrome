# DNA-Palindrome
Finding Palindrome and Quasi Palindrome sub-sequences from the entered DNA sequence
* The mail aim of this project is to find the possible sites for Hair-Pin structure formation in the DNA. 
* Finding the Palindromic and Quasi-Palindromic sub-sequences is one the primary steps towards the detection of such loop.

## Running the code:
* Clone the Repository in your local system
```
git clone https://github.com/The-Marvex/DNA-Palindrome.git
```
* Put the input sequence in the seq folder in txt format, the sequences can be broken down into new lines. The code will append them into a single line before running the checks.

* compile the code:
```
$ javac DNAChecker.java
```
* run the compiled code:
```
$ java DNAChecker
```
